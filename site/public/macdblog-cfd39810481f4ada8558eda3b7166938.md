# MACD Strategy

The MACD Strategy is one of the most famous tools used by traders to catch shifts in market momentum.

## What is MACD?

MACD stands for **Moving Average Convergence Divergence**.  
It compares two different “speeds” of the market to understand strength.

- **Fast Line (12-period)** – reacts quickly to price
- **Slow Line (26-period)** – moves smoothly
- **Signal Line (9-period)** – confirms momentum changes

## How the Trades Work

The strategy looks at the **difference (Delta)** between fast and slow averages.

### Buy (Long)
- Fast line crosses above slow line
- Delta crosses above zero

- Fast line crosses below slow line
- Delta crosses below zero
