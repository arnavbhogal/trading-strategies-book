# Channel Breakout Strategy

A pure momentum-based strategy inspired by the famous Turtle Traders.

## How It Works

- Upper Bound = highest price in N periods
- Lower Bound = lowest price in N periods
- Trade only when price breaks these levels

## Buy Signal
- Price breaks above upper bound

## Sell Signal
- Price breaks below lower bound

## Pros
- Captures large trends
- Simple logic
- Works across all markets

## Cons
- False breakouts
- Poor performance in sideways markets
